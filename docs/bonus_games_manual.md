## **Introduction**

Welcome to **Solar System Lander**, a text-based simulation game that challenges you to safely land a module on various celestial bodies within our solar system. Inspired by the classic 1982 Moonlander game, this enhanced Python version adds depth and complexity by incorporating different planets and moons, each with unique gravitational forces and atmospheric conditions.

---

## **Game Setting**

In **Solar System Lander**, you are the pilot of a landing module tasked with guiding your crew safely to the surface of a selected celestial body. The mission requires precise control of your descent, careful fuel management, and adaptation to the unique environmental conditions of each destination.

### **Available Celestial Bodies**

- **Moon**
- **Mars**
- **Earth**
- **Venus**
- **Mercury**

Each celestial body presents its own challenges, such as varying gravity levels and atmospheric densities, affecting how your lander responds to your commands.

---

## **Gameplay Overview**

### **Objective**

Safely land your module on the surface of the chosen celestial body by controlling your descent speed and managing your fuel supply.

### **Key Mechanics**

- **Gravity:** Each celestial body has a specific gravitational acceleration that pulls your lander towards its surface.
- **Atmosphere:** Some bodies have atmospheres that create drag, affecting your descent speed.
- **Fuel Management:** You have a limited amount of fuel to burn, which you must use to counteract gravity and control your descent.

### **Game Loop**

1. **Status Display:** The game shows your current time elapsed, height above the surface, velocity, and remaining fuel.
2. **Visual Indicator:** An asterisk (`*`) represents your lander's position relative to the surface.
3. **Input Phase:** If you have fuel left, you can choose how much fuel to burn (0-100 units).
4. **Calculations:**
   - **Thrust Acceleration:** Based on the amount of fuel burned.
   - **Net Acceleration:** Combines gravitational pull, thrust, and atmospheric drag (if applicable).
   - **Velocity Update:** Your new velocity after applying net acceleration.
   - **Height Update:** Your new height based on the average velocity.
5. **Landing Check:** The game checks if you've reached or passed the surface.
6. **Outcome Determination:** Based on your final velocity upon impact.

---

## **Controls**

- **Fuel Burn Input:** During each turn, input the amount of fuel you wish to burn (between 0 and 100 units). This input determines how much thrust your lander generates to counteract gravity.

### **How to Input Commands**

- **Burn Command:** When prompted with `BURN? (0 - 100):`, type an integer value within the specified range and press Enter.
- **Valid Inputs:** Whole numbers between 0 and 100, not exceeding your remaining fuel.

---

## **Strategies and Tips**

- **Understand Gravity:** Higher gravity requires more thrust to slow down. Adjust your fuel burn accordingly.
- **Manage Fuel Wisely:** Conserve fuel for critical moments. Running out of fuel may lead to an uncontrolled descent.
- **Anticipate Atmospheric Drag:** On planets with atmospheres, drag can aid in slowing your descent but can also be unpredictable.
- **Monitor Velocity:** Aim to reduce your velocity to below the safe landing threshold before touching down.
- **Plan Ahead:** Think several steps ahead to ensure you have enough fuel and time to adjust your descent.

---

## **Differences from the 1982 Original**

### **Enhanced Features**

- **Multiple Celestial Bodies:** Unlike the original Moonlander, which only simulated landing on the Moon, this version allows landings on various planets and moons.
- **Variable Gravity and Atmosphere:** Each celestial body has unique gravitational acceleration and atmospheric conditions, adding complexity to the simulation.
- **Dynamic Visual Representation:** The game includes a scaled visual indicator of your lander's height relative to the initial height.
- **Input Validation:** Improved input handling to prevent invalid entries, enhancing user experience.
- **Realistic Physics Calculations:** Incorporates atmospheric drag and more nuanced thrust calculations for a more authentic simulation.

### **Maintained Retro Feel**

- **Text-Based Interface:** Retains the classic text-based interaction, reminiscent of early computer games.
- **Simple Controls:** Uses straightforward numerical inputs for controlling the lander.
- **ASCII Visuals:** Employs basic ASCII characters for on-screen representations.
