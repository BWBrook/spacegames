        Welcome to the First Intergalactic Games! The galaxy's top engineers are competing to 
        win exclusive broadcast rights for their respective companies. You are in charge of 
        launching a satellite for New Century TV.
        
        Your task: launch a satellite into orbit by choosing the right angle and speed. The 
        satellite must reach the correct height, overcoming gravity and speed constraints.
        
        You have ten attempts to successfully launch the satellite into orbit. Too steep, too 
        shallow, too slow, or too fast â€“ and you'll fail. Do you have what it takes to succeed?
